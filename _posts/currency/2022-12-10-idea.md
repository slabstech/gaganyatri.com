Keep pushing the need 

Every day recalibrate your antennae, Look out for opportunities 

Take the lead, Build yourself and the team around your vision

You only live once

Do u live like it's your last day, or do u disappear like everyone else

Your goal, should be the reason to jump out of bed every morning.

Ikigai should be definite, audacious, never been done before, for glory only comes to those
Who eat impossible for breakfast

Time flies away, if one doesn't utilize it immediately and intelligently with direction.

Only one priority,  build a 1000 years Mars civilization.  

Everything else is a distraction and should be rejected immediately.
