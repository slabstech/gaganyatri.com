We will build the Door together - ಗಗನ್ ಯಾತ್ರಿ.

You stay away from your loved ones.

Crisis comes knocking in the middle of the night.

Those restless moments, The dam finally bursts after holding it in for a long time

You toss all sense of control and kick out everything in the way

Getting overwhelmed is the only way out

We have to get out some way and stay strong

Patience is the gift, hoping that the sky does not fall again

----

Wherever there is chaos, There is opportunity for the one who can see the clear path.

They can visualize the steps to be taken to find order in the chaos productively.

Solving the problems with simple steps, becoming useful everywhere

----

Keep pushing the need 

Every day recalibrate your antennae, Look out for opportunities 

Take the lead, Build yourself and the team around your vision

----

You only live once

Do u live like it's your last day, or do u disappear like everyone else

----

Your goal, should be the reason to jump out of bed every morning.

Ikigai should be definite, audacious, never been done before, for glory only comes to those
Who eat impossible for breakfast

Time flies away, if one doesn't utilize it immediately and intelligently with direction.

Only one priority,  build a 1000 years Mars civilization.  

Everything else is a distraction and should be rejected immediately.
