Death may be the greatest of all human blessings.

Infact the greatest blessing is when you never have to die again

When you attain moksha/nirvana. Liberation from the unrelenting cycle of rebirth.

Do good, help others, perform positive karma, Lead a worthy life

And earn that greatest blessing for yourself. A death to end all deaths.

One should not pray for one's own death, for it should happen when it's meant to happen

But one should contemplate it, plan for it, even design it to the extent possible.

For is there anything more beautiful in the entire earth than a good death ?

What makes life worth living, is figuring out what is worth dying for. And then dying for it.
