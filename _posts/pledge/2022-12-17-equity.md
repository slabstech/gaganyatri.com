* Equity
  * Do unto others as you would have them do unto you
  * One cannot expect to be given a fortune, when one does not give away
  * A good rupee always comes back with interest, same with a bad rupee, It will cause damages
  * Luxury should be relatively shared. If one's standard of living has improved, then one should also improve the standard of others 
  * Equity and Equality should go hand in hand. Since one's current fortune is due to the effort of others, one should make sure that the bounty is shared
  * Pledge to share the same amount of money on spends for self towards uplifting the grassroots and needy
