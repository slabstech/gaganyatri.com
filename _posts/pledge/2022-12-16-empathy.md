* Empathy
  * Empathy is a natural ingredient for organic growth.
  * Detachment is not required to be good or to reach consciousness
  * Goal can be reached by doing good work every day and moment
  * Expecting somebody else to solve your problem or a problem you see elsewhere will only lead to misery
  * Identify one problem, find a simple solution that does not cost money and work towards it
  * Building selflessly has a different dimension of selfcontenment
