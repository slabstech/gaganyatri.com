Climate Goal 2050 - Disaster

In 27 years, our surroundings will be un recognisable if our current growth and practices continue without steering.

We have created Climate goals for 2050, which are shambolic placeholders and pushing down responsibility for the next
generations to suffer and handle by Us.

Today we have got the erratic weather, deadly pandemic, food and energy security issues due to the actions
of the people before us. We blame them for many things, But how exactly have you and me have changed ?

Why are we pushing our responsibility to long way into the future, when it is already impossible today to recover
from major disaster. Our kids will be our age in 2050, Imagine yourself in 2050, What actions would 
you want to have taken to make it livable for the generations to come.

Act today, steer your daily practices towards Sustainable growth. Look at the alternative options, 
It takes a jolt to restart the heart, we got the pandemic as a rude jolt. 
We would not survive another devastating jolt.

Act now !!!
