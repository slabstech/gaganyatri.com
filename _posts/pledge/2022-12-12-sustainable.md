* Sustainable
    * Every work , Every design should inculcate Sustainability. Re-purpose existing materials, code, ideas
    * Do not re-invent the wheel, use the best avaialable resource and mould it into your design
    * No fossil fuels for any work, No plastics created for the product
    * Avoid over-consumption at every instant,  Its ok to go slow , like the forest grows in its own pace
