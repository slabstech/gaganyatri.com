* Story Making

https://www.paramvah.com/careers.html


Have a story to tell?

Make the synopsis as descriptive as possible. Ideally, it should contain the following:
1. The Set up & Main Characters.
2. The Conflict.
3. The Resolution.

This link should contain a brief synopsis of your script only. Only one submission per synopsis is accepted. Submissions are accepted in Kannada and English.

Our team typically takes 3-4 weeks to review your submission. In the event that you donâ€™t hear from us within the mentioned time frame, it would mean that we are unable to take things forward with respect to your submission.
